<p>A major highlight is the proposed $2.2 billion in tax cuts, including a two-year suspension of the business rent tax, which could ease the financial strain on businesses, especially small ones. Another key piece is a ""Second Amendment"" tax break on firearms and ammunition sales.</p>

<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: The unexpected rise in the unemployment rate, from 3.7% to 3.9% in February, has sparked fears of a potential recession. Economist <strong>David Rosenberg</strong> highlighted that this increase could disrupt the &#8220;soft landing narrative&#8221; and potentially lead to an unanticipated recession, <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/next-recession-economy-outlook-unemployment-rate-rise-february-jobs-report-2024-3"">reported</a> Business Insider.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that the jobless rate is up 0.5 of a percentage point from the January 2023 cycle low, it messes up the soft landing narrative because once it rises this much from the lows, the recession nobody ever sees coming arrives,&#8221; Rosenberg said in a Friday note.</p>

<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The 2024 budget of the foundation, approved by its board, indicates a 4% increase from the previous year and $2 billion more than in 2021. The foundation attributed this increase to a general fall in global health budgets, particularly in low-income countries, according to a Reuters report.</p>
<p>Despite criticism for its significant influence, the Gates Foundation remains a major global health contributor. Its CEO, <strong>Mark Suzman</strong>, affirmed the foundation&#8217;s commitment to its mission until other organizations can fill the gap.

Health care and social assistance led the way with a gain of 87,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate ticked higher to 3.9% against expectations it would hold steady at 3.8%. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% sequentially and 3.9% year over year, both below consensus estimates. The jobless rate tied for the highest level since January 2022. The labor force participation rate, or those actively looking for work, was unchanged at 62.7%.</p>
<p>The slower job growth could be good news on the inflation front but cause economic slowdown. Below, we have highlighted some of the sectors that will likely see smooth trading in the days ahead in light of the April jobs data.</p>

<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> In an interview on Thursday, Yellen stated that the U.S. economic growth might be stronger than the weaker-than-expected data on first-quarter output suggests, Reuters reported.
