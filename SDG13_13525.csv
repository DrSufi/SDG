Yet governments and corporations are increasingly turning to them to offset emissions, rather than reducing fossil fuel use or developing more permanent CO2 disposal options. Emissions accounting rules encourage this by creating an apparent equivalence between fossil fuel emissions and drawdown of CO2 by some natural carbon sinks, meaning a country could appear to have 'achieved net zero' whilst still contributing to ongoing warming.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/11/241118125147.htm,Global,Not applicable,Not applicable,International,Climate Change Report,2024-11-18 12:51:47.0000000,136.80000000000000000,NULL,NULL

<p>New York, United States, Oct.  15, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Electric vehicles were developed to replace conventional modes of transportation that pollute the environment. Electric vehicles have grown in popularity as a result of numerous technological advancements. Electric vehicles (EVs) outperform conventional vehicles in fuel economy, greenhouse gas emissions, ease of home charging, smoother ride, and lower engine noise. Battery, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are the three types of electric vehicles. In addition, electric vehicles do not require oil changes, but they are marginally more expensive than gasoline-powered vehicles. Installation and system integration of electric vehicles necessitates stringent safety checks.

<p>ING today published its annual Climate Progress Update. The update shows how we engage with our clients to help them in the transition to a low-carbon economy. It also includes our progress on steering the most carbon-intensive sectors in our loan portfolio towards global climate goals – our ‘Terra&#039; approach. As a bank, the most impactful way for us to contribute to the transition is through financing: working with clients on their transitions to net zero while financing the technologies and solutions needed for a sustainable future. And because the global transition needs to include everyone, we&#039;re also finding new ways to enable people to stay a step ahead on climate change.</p>
