<p>Golden, CO, Nov.  13, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Energy stored in thermochemical materials can effectively heat indoor spaces, particularly in humid regions, according to researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy&#039;s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).</p>
<p>Working with industry representatives and researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the scientists determined a realistic configuration for integrating thermochemical materials (TCMs) into a building&#039;s HVAC system. Salt-hydrate TCMs are considered promising candidates for providing load flexibility to a building&#039;s heating system. This flexibility could allow for reduced electrical requirements for the heating system or load shifting to times when electricity is less expensive and/or cleaner.</p>
<p>The TCM is discharged and charged through hydration and dehydration reactions, respectively.

Broadly speaking, the market tends to do well during election years. And this is particularly true in the two months after the election has been decided. The reason for this is that elections remove uncertainty. Investors can and have made money regardless of the party in power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, getting clarity on what the next four years may bring will direct investor sentiment. The outcome of this election could have significant repercussions for tax policy, energy policy, and the overall economy. For example, in late 2020 and early 2021, renewable energy stocks surged on the premise that money would flow into these companies. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Albuquerque, NM, July  10, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Almost every city that existed prior to the 1970s has neighborhoods that reflect traditional home-building styles. These sought-after, older neighborhoods often possess charm and high property values based on the distinct character of older homes.

Those unfinished spaces can be a breeding ground for mold that can contaminate indoor air, making the homes unhealthy to live in.</p>
<p><i>Why Are Older Homes Different From Newer Ones?</i><br />During the 1970s, the innovation of central air conditioning coupled with the energy crisis of the 1970s changed home construction as energy efficiency became the priority. As a result, newer residential structures with tighter building envelopes became standard. Floorplans, construction m",https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/24/07/g39715720/immunolytics-older-homes-have-increased-likelihood-of-mold,Older homes,Not specified,Not specified,Local,Environmental News,2024-07-10 18:00:00.0000000,23.40000000000000000,NULL,NULL
