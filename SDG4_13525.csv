<p>Santa Fe, NM, May  14, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- May 29 is recognized as National 529 Education Savings Plan Day, a day devoted to raising awareness of tax-advantaged 529 plans, an option added to the tax code in 1996 that makes investing for future education more appealing. 529 Day encourages families to start planning for their loved ones&#039; future education needs. Recent data shows that due to rising college costs, families should save at least $2,000 more over a five-year period as compared to previous years. Starting to save early is key, and education-specific savings plans like 529 education savings plans can help families maximize their savings with tax benefits and tailored investment options designed specifically for paying educational expenses.</p>

The move is aimed at protecting a long-desired rally.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report, the Beijing exchange has been rejecting filings from major shareholders, defined as those owning a 5% or more stake, who are required to make a public filing before selling shares.</p>
<p>The policy implementation comes after the benchmark 50 Index of the exchange saw a surge of 46% this month, supported by recent measures by authorities. These measures included lowering the required amount of funds an investor must have in their stock account to invest, improving trading mechanisms, and encouraging mutual funds to participate in the market.</p>

<p>The extension is in response to the announcement by the U.S. Department of Education this week that essential information from the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) would be delayed at least until ""the first half of March."" The FAFSA contains information vital for the processing of financial aid packages. Without FAFSA information, most colleges and universities cannot provide a complete financial aid package, and therefore, families cannot assess the true cost of attendance. Normally, colleges and universities receive FAFSA data beginning in November and in subsequent batches over many months. </p>

<p>In 2022, the state eliminated taxes on social security for most recipients and cut the Gross Receipts Tax for the first time in 40 years on goods and services. Those efforts, as well as tuition-free college, expanded early childhood education, strong job growth, quality outdoor recreation and cultural amenities, are solidifying New Mexico&#039;s position as a place where families can succeed while enjoying the quality-of-life New Mexico has to offer.</p>

<p>New York, United States, Dec.  11, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agritourism is the practice of visiting a functioning agricultural area for leisure, amusement, or education. Farm-based recreational activities are generally included. Agritourism is a type of tourism that combines farming with tourism. It allows visitors to learn more about agriculture and see the unique rural lands, and it is often referred to as rural or farm tourism. Agritourism is gaining popularity among farmers since it gives additional money to farmers in addition to their farm-producing activities and helps them be more sustainable. Because it is cost-effective, there is a desire for a family-oriented recreation environment and a growing curiosity about agricultural activities in young minds. It has enormous potential to bring good business to farmers.</p>
