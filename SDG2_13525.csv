<p align=""left"">NORFOLK, Va., May  08, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As summer approaches, the Foodbank of Southeastern Virginia and the Eastern Shore is proud to launch <em>Hunger Heroes</em>, a revitalized initiative designed to fight seasonal hunger and bring fresh, nutritious food directly to communities in need.</p>
<p>With schools closed and donations down, many families face a sharp increase in food insecurity during the summer months. <em>Hunger Heroes</em> meets this need head-on by providing seasonal produce, dairy, protein, and pantry staples through our 757 Mobile Market. These client-choice distributions, fully sponsored by corporate partners, serve approximately 50 households per event and empower families to select the items they need most, preserving dignity while reducing food waste.</p>

What was once an agricultural lifeline is now a barren landscape, as prolonged droughts have devastated crops and livelihoods. Farmers, whose survival depends entirely on the land, are facing a catastrophe they never imagined. Their crops have withered under the scorching sun, and with them, hopes of feeding their families and sustaining their communities. As hunger spreads, a painful question looms large: How much longer can they hold on? This crisis is not just another fleeting challenge but a vivid and painful reminder of the ever-growing threat of climate change. For many in the north of Cameroon, the weather is not just unpredictable; it is becoming an unforgiving enemy. The once-reliable rainy season has grown shorter and less frequent, replaced by longer, harsher dry spells.
