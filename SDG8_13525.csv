<p>U.S. markets rebounded this week, fully recovering losses incurred since President <strong>Donald Trump</strong>&#039;s April 2 tariff escalation. The S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq each rose by more than 1.3%, with Friday marking the S&amp;P 500&#039;s ninth consecutive daily gain — the longest streak since 2004.</p>
<p>The rally was fueled by a stronger-than-expected April jobs report, with 177,000 jobs added, surpassing forecasts of 135,000. Unemployment remained at 4.2%, and sectors like healthcare and transportation led job growth. However, Q1 GDP contracted by 0.3%, the largest drop since 2022, largely due to a surge in imports ahead of tariff implementations.</p>

<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> In a detailed thread on X, Schiff referred to Vice President <strong>JD Vance</strong>&#8216;s address at a recent AI summit, where Vance called &#8216;cheap labor&#8217; a drug for American industries, criticized it for restraining innovation and stated that President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> intends to roll back 40 years of globalization.</p>
<p>According to Schiff, while globalization has led to the hollowing of America&#8217;s industrial base and the decimation of the middle class, it has also kept consumer prices in check and funneled inflation into financial markets. This, he says, has created an illusion of economic growth.</p>

When inflation runs hot, it benefits stocks overall, and the opposite is true. Inflation brings on higher earnings through pricing power and margin expansion for most businesses, and the weakening impact it has on the dollar drives stock prices higher.</p>
<p>However, not all stocks are made equal. Some actually suffer during inflation as they cannot keep up with economic growth. The same is true when slowing inflation hits the economy. Instead of placing a bearish bias on the whole S&amp;P 500, investors can apply some fundamental reasoning to find potential stocks that may outperform during the next couple of quarters.</p>

The index futures are modestly higher early Tuesday. China, the second largest economy in the world, decided to go bold, with the nation&#8217;s central bank announcing a series of stimulatory measures. This has sent commodities soaring, given China is a commodity-guzzling country. China&#8217;s growth has a bearing on the rest of the global economy as it is often called the world&#8217;s factory.</p>
<p>In the domestic market, traders may look ahead to a speech by a Federal Reserve official, a consumer confidence reading and a couple of house prices data. Momentum suggests additional gains but the overbought levels may introduce caution, especially ahead of key inflation data due this week and more labor market data that would roll out next week.</p>

While the producer price index (a measure of wholesale prices) was up 0.1% last month, the consumer price index (a broad-based measure of prices for goods and services) increased 0.2%. This put the 12-month inflation rate at 2.9% &mdash; the lowest since March 2021.</p>
<p>While the data gave an uncertain market some direction after the erratic movement last week, it also portrayed the resilience of the economy. This, in turn, led to optimism about a possible rate cut by the Federal Reserve next month, triggering an uptrend for the stocks. With a better-than-expected 2.8% annualized GDP growth in the second quarter and solid labor market conditions, it appeared that the economy was back on the growth track, cooling recessionary fears.</p>
