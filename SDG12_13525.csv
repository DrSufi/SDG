This bold step forward aligns with Pangea&#039;s ongoing commitment to sustainability and responsible manufacturing practices.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In 2023, Pangea&#039;s Leon manufacturing site isolated nearly 2,000 metric tons of leather shavings as part of this initiative, diverting this material from landfills and turning it into a valuable resource for biostimulant manufacturing. These biostimulants are then used to create sustainable fertilizers, contributing to a circular economy.</p>
